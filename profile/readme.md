Overview
--------
Canadian Physical AI institute (CPAI) is building Canada's first open ecosystem for Physical AI - a credible, human-centered institute for embodied intelligence. CPAI is a community for engineers, researchers, factories, and startups who want to shape the future of Physical AI.

Vision
------
Make Canada the go-to hub for Physical AI, where innovation moves from concept to creation. Through CPAI, builders gain the community, infrastructure, and support to develop physical products faster, safer, and with fewer barriers. The goal is an ecosystem where anyone who wants to build intelligent products can, and where the world comes to do it.

Mission
-------
Make the creation of Physical AI - intelligent hardware, robotics, and autonomous systems - as simple, ethical, and collaborative as building software. From learning and prototyping to team formation, standards, and funding readiness, CPAI is designing an open ecosystem for embodied intelligence. Founding contributors help define the standards, ethics, and technologies the world will follow.

Foundation Pillars
------------------
- Research and Standards: publish research, landscape reports, benchmarks, and proposed standards.
- Community and Education: meetups, workshops, open courses, and structured learning paths.
- Projects and Innovation: hands-on projects with startups, factories, students, and researchers.

### 🏛️ About the Institute
The **Canadian Physical AI Institute** is an open research initiative focused on the "boring but critical" infrastructure of robotics. We develop standards, tools, and diagnostics that prevent silent failures in autonomous systems.

### 🔭 Current Flagship Initiative
**[SensorGuardian](LINK_TO_REPO)**
> A lightweight, open-source diagnostic standard for ROS2 sensor streams. It detects "silent" failures—like frozen frames and QoS mismatches—before they cause physical crashes. 
> * **Status:** Active Development (v0.1)
> * **Stack:** C++17, ROS2, Python
> [cite_start]* **Seek:** Contributors for Middleware & QA[cite: 35, 53].

### 🤝 Strategic Pillars
1.  **Reliability First:** We prioritize system uptime and data integrity over novel algorithms.
2.  **Open Standards:** All tools are open-source (Apache 2.0) to encourage industry-wide adoption.
3.  **Academic-Industry Bridge:** Connecting Montreal's AI ecosystem with practical engineering.
