Overview
--------
Canadian Physical AI institute (CPAI) is building Canada's first open ecosystem for Physical AI - a credible, human-centered institute for embodied intelligence. CPAI is a community for engineers, researchers, factories, and startups who want to shape the future of Physical AI.

Vision
------
Make Canada the go-to hub for Physical AI, where innovation moves from concept to creation. Through CPAI, builders gain the community, infrastructure, and support to develop physical products faster, safer, and with fewer barriers. The goal is an ecosystem where anyone who wants to build intelligent products can, and where the world comes to do it.

Mission
-------
Make the creation of Physical AI - intelligent hardware, robotics, and autonomous systems - as simple, ethical, and collaborative as building software. From learning and prototyping to team formation, standards, and funding readiness, CPAI is designing an open ecosystem for embodied intelligence. Founding contributors help define the standards, ethics, and technologies the world will follow.

Projects Page (Active Initiatives and Research Sprints)
-------------------------------------------------------
The projects page presents active sprints with clear deliverables, leadership support, and a tight handoff rhythm. Current active initiatives include:

01 - SensorGuardian (Offline Sensor Health Analysis)
- Summary: Open-source, offline tool for analyzing ROS 2 rosbags and generating deterministic sensor health reports. Detects silent sensor degradation, synchronization issues, and data integrity problems before deployment or debugging.
- The Task: Build health checks for cameras, LiDAR, IMU, and GPS; parse rosbag2 data; ship human-readable and machine-readable reports; validate checks against real-world failure cases; maintain golden test bags and regression tests.
- Ideal For: Robotics and ROS 2 engineers, QA and validation engineers, autonomy engineers focused on reliability and safety.
- Status: Active development with architecture and v0.1 scope defined.

02 - Physical AI Pains Report (Market Research Program)
- Summary: Industry-grounded research sprint focused on real Physical AI deployment constraints in Canada.
- The Task: Conduct one in-depth industry interview; extract and validate a high-impact pain point; synthesize findings into a standardized, one-page market-facing report.
- Ideal For: Bachelor's and graduate students in Mechanical Engineering, Computer Science, Robotics; early-career engineers interested in industry, startups, or applied AI deployment.
- Status: Active research sprint with defined scope, interview criteria, templates, and publication pipeline.

03 - DroneMeta (Metadata Forensics)
- Summary: Open-source tool for extracting, normalizing, and validating metadata from consumer and industrial drone imagery, focused on reliability, provenance, and forensic integrity.
- The Task: Parse metadata from DJI, Autel, Parrot, and open formats; normalize outputs into a deterministic JSON schema; detect inconsistencies, missing fields, and tampering indicators; build a public metadata sample zoo for testing.
- Ideal For: Python developers, GIS and geospatial engineers, drone operators and forensic analysts.
- Status: Definition complete. Development begins when the core contributor set is in place.

04 - DebugCam (Camera Diagnostics)
- Summary: Lightweight debugging tool for analyzing camera streams (USB, RTSP, ROS topics) and detecting dropped frames, timing jitter, and synchronization issues without dashboards or GUIs.
- The Task: Implement stream adapters; measure latency, frame drops, and timestamp drift; output deterministic diagnostic reports; build reproducible tests for unstable streams.
- Ideal For: Computer vision engineers, robotics developers, video systems engineers.
- Status: Architecture and scope defined. Looking for maintainers to kick off v0.1.

05 - SensorReplay (Failure Simulation)
- Summary: Open-source toolkit for replaying and mutating sensor data to reproduce failure modes such as noise bursts, dropouts, drift, and desynchronization, entirely offline.
